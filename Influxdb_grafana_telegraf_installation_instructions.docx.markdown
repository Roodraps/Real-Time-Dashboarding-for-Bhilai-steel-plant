    server to start automatically on boot, use the following command:

*sudo systemctl enable grafana-server*

  - Configure the firewall: If you are using a firewall, you need to
    allow access to the Grafana server. For example, on Ubuntu, you can
    use the following command:

*sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp*

  - Access the Grafana web interface: Open a web browser and go to
    http://\<server-ip\>:3000. You should see the Grafana login page.
